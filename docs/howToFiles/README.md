# How to ...
Here we will have a description of the main functionalities of this repo and what to do to use it

## Log the experiment data 
To log all info required from and experiment log the analog, stateExt and inertial ports using [sensor calib][1] or this [yarpManagerApp][2].

## Prepare the experiment data 
To prepare the loged information to be used by the repo you need to create a [params.m](https://github.com/robotology-playground/insitu-ft-analysis/blob/master/paramsTemplate.m) file and put it in the directory of the experiment inside the data directory.
There are some variables that are common to all icub robots, some depend on the specific robot used, some depend on how and what you loged in the experiment and others depend on the characteristics of the experiment itslef. **Note:** a params.m copy from a previous similar experiment can be used directly. 

Detailed information on how to [Prepare the experiment data ](https://github.com/robotology-playground/insitu-ft-analysis/blob/master/docs/howToFiles/prepareData.md).


 

## Read an experiment
To read and experiment you can use [readExperiment.m](https://github.com/robotology-playground/insitu-ft-analysis/blob/master/utils/readExperiment.m).

This function is meant to read all info available in a dataset from analog, stateExt, inertial and skin\_events ports logged using [sensor calib][1] or this [yarpManagerApp][2]. It gives some extra functionalities depending on the options enabled.

Obtained Information:
-  timeStamp of the experiment
-  joints positions, velocities and accelerations
-  force/torque measurements and estimation
-  motor side enconder positions, velocities and accelerations (optional not implemented at the moment but ready for it)
-  joint torques
-  inertial data 

Output variables:
-  dataset: structure containinng all obtained information. Fields are:
   - time: timestamp
   - qj: joint positions
   - dqj: joint velocities
   - ddqj: joint accelereations
   - ftData: measured forces and torques
   - estimatedFtData: estimated forces and torques
   - filteredFtData: filtered forces and torques
   - rawData: raw measurements
   - rawDataFiltered: raw measurements calculated from filteredFtData
   - cMat: calibration matrices
   - jointNames: names of joints from urdf model
   - calibMatFileName: the name of the file containing the cailbration matrix of a sensor
-  estimator: iDynTree.ExtWrenchesAndJointTorquesEstimator() class with a
  the model of the robot loaded
-  input: configuration variables read in the [params.m](https://github.com/robotology-playground/insitu-ft-analysis/blob/master/paramsTemplate.m) file
-  extraSample: structure containinng all obtained information from another subset of experiments 

Input variables:
-  experimentName: address and name of the experiment in the data folder
-  scriptOptions should include :
    -  scriptOptions.forceCalculation
       - posible values:true ,false
       - behavior: if true it will retrieve previously stored .mat files with the experiment data if available
    -  scriptOptions.testDir=false;
       - posible values:true ,false
       - behavior: if true it will consider to be in a directory below the main directory of the repository. Most common case the testResults dir
    -  scriptOptions.filterData=true;
       - posible values:true ,false
       - behavior: if true it will filter the ft data
    -  scriptOptions.raw=false;
       - posible values:true ,false
       - behavior: if true it will calculate what the raw values by pre-multiplying by the inverse calibratio matrix
    -  scriptOptions.estimateWrenches=true;
       - posible values:true ,false
       - behavior: if true it will estimate the forces and torques using iDyntree methods
    -  scriptOptions.useInertial=false;
       - posible values:true ,false
       - behavior: if true it will use the imu for calculating forces and torques from floating base
    -  scriptOptions.saveData=true;
       - posible values:true ,false
       - behavior: if true it will save the dataset structure into a  "scriptOptions.matFileName".mat file in the experiment directory 
    -  scriptOptions.matFileName='iCubDataset';
       - posible values: any string, most used iCubDataset or ftDataset
       - behavior: name of the file with which the data will be saved

## Analyze a sensor performance
To analyze a sensor performance the script [analyzeSensorUsingGridDataset.m](https://github.com/robotology-playground/insitu-ft-analysis/blob/master/analizeSensorUsingGridDataset.m) can be used.

This script take dataset in the "grid" format (generated by [sensorSelfCalibrator][1] module and copied to [greeny datasets][2] 
with the according params.m file [2] ) on the iCub robot and compare the eccentrity of the force measurement. In theory the "grid" movement is slowly (so the only thing that matters is gravity) moving the legs, while the robot is fixed on the pole (so the only external force are on the root_link).

The measured force should be equal to m*g , where g \in R^3 is the gravity expressed in the sensor frame. Hence the measured force should lie on a sphere (eccentrities 0,0) in theory. However imperfect sensor can have a different eccentricities ( but in general they remain linear, so the sphere become an ellipsoid).
For more on the theory behind this script, check [1,2].
