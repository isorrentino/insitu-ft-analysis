## Inspect a dataset
### on development

%% This script is aimed to be useful for inspecting the data.
%  It will be divided into different parts for the different parts :
% Saturation-> look at raw data, possibly comparing with reference data
% No external force perturbation in grid-> plot wrench space and look for
%    forces out of the ellipsoid expected shape. Only for grid datasets
% Visualize forces vs time -> FTplots, it can help select the intervals
